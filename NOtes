Abstarct Class:
-> it contains both abstract and concrete method.it is need to share code among several related classes. It is partial implementation of abstraction.
Abstraction:
-> it is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. it helps manage complexity by hiding unnecessary
details and exposing only relevant features to the user.
encapsulation:
-> it is process of bundling the data and the methods that operate on that data with single unit or object, keeping internal working hidden from outside world
   it helps to achieve data hiding and abstraction.
Inheritance:
->It allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.it establishes relationship as parent and child
1. single inheritance:one parent to one child
2. multiple inheritance:  A class implements multiple interfaces (Java does not allow extending multiple classes).
3. multilevel inheritance: A chain of inheritance: grandparent → parent → child.
4. hierarchical inheritance: One parent class with multiple child classes.
5. hybrid inheritance: A mix of class inheritance + multiple interfaces.

Interface:
->it is a contract that specifies what a class must do without dictating how it should do it. it defines a set of abstract methods that implementing classes must
provide. interface enables polymorphism and helps achieve loose coupling in software design.

Polymorphism:
->The ability of an object to take on many forms. In object-oriented programming, this typically manifests as objects of different classes being treated as instances
of a common superclass or implementing a common interface. This includes method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism).

KEY POINTS:
-> static methods can be accessed directly but public methods only be accessed by object.
-> super is used for accessing attribute or methods from the parent class in the subclass.
-> Tight coupling: where two or more classes or components are highly dependent on each other, meaning changes in one component often necessitate changes in the other.
This dependency typically arises when one class directly instantiates another concrete class or directly accesses its internal implementation details.
-> loose coupling:designing a system where components or classes have minimal dependencies on each other, interacting through stable, abstract interfaces rather than concrete
 implementations. This separation makes the system more flexible, maintainable, and testable.

Solid principles:
----------------
Single Responsibility Principle:
-> Class should have only one reason to change, it means it should have only one job or one responsibility. This principle helps create more maintainable and flexible code
by ensuring that classes are focused and cohesive
